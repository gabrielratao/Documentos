# The CLEAN Initiative

The Collaborative Low-cost Environmental Air-quality Network (CLEAN) consists of an IoT solution for low-cost environmental air quality monitoring. CLEAN allows several low-cost monitoring devices to send their data to a web server for real-time and geolocated visualization of air pollutants, throughout the RENOVAr web application. The main goal of this network is to contribute to the development of the low-cost air quality monitoring paradigm. In order to achieve that goal, the CLEAN initiative provides 3 major components: i) tutorials and guides for developing low-cost monitors and connecting to the network, ii) hardware and firmware documentation of the air quality monitors, iii) and the RENOVAr web application for data visualization and analysis.  All the hardware, firmware, and software required for collaborating on the network are open, as well as the tutorials, developing guides, and registration on the platform, which are available for free. This repository contains the main program for the CLEAN Arduino Mega Board v0.0, the main program for the CLEAN ESP8266 Gateway, the firmware libraries and a set of test projects developed for testing the hardware of the CLEAN Arduino Mega Board v0.0.
